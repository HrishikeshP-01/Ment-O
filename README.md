## Problem with std. Psychiatric evaluations
- Makes the candidate feel insecure
- Can induce a feeling of abnormality while taking the “test”.
- Most candidates are not completely truthful resulting in inaccurate evaluations.
- Candidates don’t feel relaxed in a hospital atmosphere which influences decisions made by them.

## What it does
- Gamifies psychiatric evaluations.
- Employs a third person perspective thereby ensuring that the candidates don't feel probed.
- Web-based & compatible with any browser. The candidate can take the test wherever they feel secure.
- Ment-O focuses on the Rosenzweig Evaluation

## Why Rosenzweig’s ?
- Caters to the mental problems of a larger demographic.
- Deals with depression, frustration & submission which is one of the most common mental health issues faced by adults & children alike.
- Easy enough for the candidates to analyse themselves in case they don’t have the means to seek professional help.

## Features of Ment-O
- Monochromatic UI ensuring certain individuals won’t get triggered by the imagery.
- Easy to use interface that caters to a wider demographic.
- Instantaneous psychiatric evaluations.
- Free to use & open-source.
- Guaranteed privacy.

## How I built it
Ment-O has been built using Unity & Photoshop. I did a lot of research on Rosenzweigh's frustration tests and the different types of responses & marking schemes & weighting matrices to make an algorithm that determines the user's mental state based on 3 levels - Aggression, Submission & rationality.

## Challenges I ran into
- This is my first Unity project so I spent most of my time learning C# & the basics of the Unity Editor.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
- I didn't think I could learn Unity in such a short time by I did & also released the game.
- I released the game! It can be played in Itch.io on your browser for free!

## What we learned
- Learned the basics of Unity.
- Learned about various mental health issues in the society & the various psychiatric evaluations that can be performed to diagnose them before it's too late.

## What's next for Ment-O
- Ment-O is open-source.
- I plan to gamify few other types of psychiatric evaluations if all goes well.
